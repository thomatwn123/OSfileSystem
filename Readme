OS Final Project Readme v1 (12/6/2017)
======================================

# Current work division:
	- Tim		: (fs.c, header.h) Main driver program, UI, Header file, documentation
	- Kohila	: (ls.h) List file
	- Susanta	: (rm.h) Delete file
	- San		: (mv.h) Rename/move file, git repository
	- MSG		: (touch.h) Create file
	- Neil		: (cat.h) Show file content
	
# Git repository:
	- Link: https://github.com/git4san/OSfilesystem
	- Working branch: master
	
# Notes:
	- Remember to sign up for a git account, and then send San your email and username, so that he can add you to the repository (for push and pull to teh repo).

# How to work your part in the project:
	- Everyone is responsible for the assigned task as listed above.
	- Everyone will do:
		1. Upload only a single file (e.g.: ls.h for Kohila, rm.h for Susanta, etc.).
		2. You will create a function with the following name:
			> Kohila	: ls
			> Susanta	: rm
			> San		: mv
			> MSG		: touch
			> Neil		: cat
		3. Your code will look something like this:
			// (ls.h) List file
			#ifndef ls_h
			#define ls_h
			
			#include <stdio.h>
			// include needed library here
			
			// Type in the comment about how to use your function, what to give as input and how to retrieve the output
			void lsFunc(/*Replace with your own input/output variable here*/){
				/*Replace with your working code*/
			}
			
			#endif
		4. So in the end we will have this functions:
			> lsFunc, rmFunc, mvFunc, touchFunc, catFunc
		5. You can take a look at the fs.c to testing your program
		6. Compilation command:
			$ gcc fs.c -o OSfs
		7. To run the compiled program:
			$ ./OSfs
		8. You can use the git web UI in the link above to upload your *.h file
		
# Next goal and timeline:
- (11 Dec 2017) Finish your *.h file, so that i can integrate and do testing
